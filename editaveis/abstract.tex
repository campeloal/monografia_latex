 \begin{otherlanguage*}{english}
  	The usage of mobile devices is emerging and is notable the importance of visual effects in games and the performance restriction of the graphical processors of these platforms. This way, the purpose of this academic work is based on the development and experimental approximation of asymptotic computational complexity of shaders (programs responsible for the visual effects) for Android and iOS platform. Their asymptotic complexities will be analyzed, based on number of instructions per second and rendering time metrics, depending on the number of polygons rendered. Besides, the method of least squares will be used to adjust the values obtained, being able to estimate which curve has better approximation to the original function.
