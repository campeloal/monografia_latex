 \begin{otherlanguage*}{english}
  	The usage of mobile devices and Android platform is emerging and is notable the importance of visual effects in games and its performance restriction. This way, the purpose of this academic work is based on the development of shaders (programs responsible for the visual effects) for Android platform and computer, which algorithm complexities will be analyzed, based on the frames per second metric. Besides, the method of least squares will be used to adjust the values obtained from a curve, being able to estimate the maximum quantity of polygons to be executed for a specified frames per second rate, related to a specific shader.
